# Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Build Status: COMPLETE

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING: Netlify Showing Old Version**

### **Quick Fixes (Try in order):**

#### 1. **Force Redeploy in Netlify Dashboard**
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Click **"Site settings"** → **"Build & deploy"**
3. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**
4. This forces a fresh build from your latest commit

#### 2. **Clear Netlify Cache**
1. In Netlify dashboard → **"Site settings"**
2. Go to **"Build & deploy"** → **"Post processing"**
3. Click **"Clear cache and deploy site"**

#### 3. **Check Build Logs**
1. Go to **"Deploys"** tab in Netlify
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check if build failed or used wrong commit
4. Look for any error messages

#### 4. **Verify Git Connection**
1. In Netlify: **"Site settings"** → **"Build & deploy"** → **"Continuous deployment"**
2. Ensure correct repository and branch (should be `main`)
3. Check if webhook is properly configured

#### 5. **Force Push (if needed)**
```bash
# Make a small change to force new commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Netlify redeploy"
git push origin main
```
